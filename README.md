# Linear-Algebra
Here I am learning Linear Algebra from NPTEL and MIT OCW.

The most important thing that you will learn in Linear Algebra is Singular Value Decomposition.

The major things that we need to learn are: 

1) Vector space, subspaces
2) Linear independence and dependence
3) Different types of distances like metric space, norms spaces, inner products etc
4) Different types of matrices
5) Eigen value decomposition
6) LU Decomposition
7) QR Decomposition
8) Singular Value Decomposition
9) Principal Component Analysis
10) Sensitivity analysis
11) Graph Theory
12) Page rank algorithm
13) Least squares approximation of a matrix
